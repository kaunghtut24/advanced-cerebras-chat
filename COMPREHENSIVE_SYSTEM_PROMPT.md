## RAG (Knowledge Base) Instructions

### **When RAG is Enabled:**

The system adds **CRITICAL MANDATORY INSTRUCTIONS**:

```
üî¥ CRITICAL - KNOWLEDGE BASE CONTEXT PROVIDED üî¥

ABSOLUTE REQUIREMENTS:
1. READ the entire knowledge base context carefully
2. Your PRIMARY obligation is to answer based on this knowledge base
3. You MUST cite source files: "According to [filename]..."
4. You MUST quote directly when appropriate
5. If KB answers the question: Use ONLY KB content
6. If KB partially answers: Use KB first, supplement with general knowledge
7. If KB doesn't answer: State this explicitly, then provide general knowledge

RESPONSE FORMAT:
- Start with: "Based on the knowledge base..." or "According to [filename]..."
- Cite every piece: "As stated in [filename]..."
- Quote key passages: "The document states: '...'"
- End with: "Source: [list of files used]"
```

### **Visual Presentation:**

Let me compare our internal refund policy with industry standards:

## Our Internal Policy

According to our knowledge base (refund_policy.pdf), our refund policy allows 
customers to request a full refund within 30 days of purchase.

## Industry Standards

According to Retail Dive (https://retaildive.com/...), the industry standard 
for refund windows ranges from 14 to 30 days, with most retailers offering 
30 days for standard purchases.

## Comparison

Combining our internal documentation with current industry information, our 
30-day refund policy aligns with the upper end of industry standards, matching 
what most major retailers offer. This positions us competitively in the market.
