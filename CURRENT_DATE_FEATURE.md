# Current Date/Time Feature

## Overview

The model now **automatically receives the current date and time** in every request. This enables it to provide **up-to-date information** when using web search and understand time-sensitive queries.

---

## What Changed

### **Date Information Added to System Prompt**

Every request now includes:

```
CURRENT DATE AND TIME INFORMATION:
Today's date: January 04, 2025
Current time: 02:30 PM
Full date/time: Saturday, January 04, 2025 at 02:30 PM

IMPORTANT: When searching the web or providing information about 
current events, news, or time-sensitive topics, use this date as 
reference. This helps you provide the most up-to-date and relevant 
information.
```

---

## Benefits

### **1. Accurate Time-Sensitive Responses**

**Before (without date):**
```
User: What are the latest AI developments?
Bot: Here are some recent AI developments...
     [Might reference old information]
```

**After (with date):**
```
User: What are the latest AI developments?
Bot: As of January 4, 2025, here are the latest AI developments...
     [Knows to search for January 2025 information]
```

---

### **2. Better Web Search Queries**

**Example 1: News Queries**

```
User: What's happening in AI today?

Model knows: Today is January 4, 2025
Web search: "AI news January 2025"
Result: Most recent articles from January 2025
```

**Example 2: Event Queries**

```
User: What tech conferences are coming up?

Model knows: Today is January 4, 2025
Web search: "tech conferences 2025 upcoming"
Result: Events scheduled after January 2025
```

---

### **3. Relative Time Understanding**

**Example 1: "Recent" Queries**

```
User: What were the recent AI breakthroughs?

Model knows: Today is January 4, 2025
Interprets "recent" as: December 2024 - January 2025
Web search: "AI breakthroughs December 2024 January 2025"
```

**Example 2: "This Week" Queries**

```
User: What happened in tech this week?

Model knows: Today is Saturday, January 4, 2025
Interprets "this week" as: December 30, 2024 - January 4, 2025
Web search: "tech news week of December 30 2024"
```

---

### **4. Temporal Context for RAG**

**Example:**

```
User: How does our Q4 2024 performance compare to industry?

Model knows: Today is January 4, 2025
- Searches knowledge base for Q4 2024 data
- Searches web for "industry performance Q4 2024"
- Provides comparison with proper temporal context
```

# In the chat endpoint, before building system prompt
from datetime import datetime

current_date = datetime.now().strftime("%B %d, %Y")
current_time = datetime.now().strftime("%I:%M %p")
current_datetime_full = datetime.now().strftime("%A, %B %d, %Y at %I:%M %p %Z")

# Prepend to system prompt
system_prompt = f"""CURRENT DATE AND TIME INFORMATION:
Today's date: {current_date}
Current time: {current_time}
Full date/time: {current_datetime_full}

IMPORTANT: When searching the web or providing information about current events, 
news, or time-sensitive topics, use this date as reference. This helps you provide 
the most up-to-date and relevant information.

{system_prompt}
"""
```

## Best Practices

### **For Users:**

‚úÖ **Use relative time terms** - "today", "this week", "last month"  
‚úÖ **Ask about current events** - Model knows what "current" means  
‚úÖ **Request recent information** - Model will search for latest data  
‚úÖ **Compare time periods** - Model understands temporal context  

### **For Developers:**

‚úÖ **Date is auto-updated** - No manual intervention needed  
‚úÖ **Server timezone used** - Configure server timezone appropriately  
‚úÖ **Prepended to all prompts** - Consistent across all requests  
‚úÖ **Works with RAG and Web Search** - Enhances both features  

---

## Limitations

### **1. Timezone Awareness**

‚ö†Ô∏è **Uses server timezone** - Not user's local timezone  
‚ö†Ô∏è **No automatic timezone conversion** - Shows server time only  

**Workaround:** Configure server to use appropriate timezone

---

### **2. Time Precision**

‚ö†Ô∏è **Minute-level precision** - Not second-level  
‚ö†Ô∏è **Updated per request** - Not real-time within conversation  

**Impact:** Minimal for most use cases

---

### **3. Historical Queries**

‚ö†Ô∏è **Model still has knowledge cutoff** - Can't know events after training  
‚ö†Ô∏è **Relies on web search** - For post-cutoff information  

**Solution:** Enable web search for current events

---

## Troubleshooting

### **Problem 1: Wrong Date Shown**

**Cause:** Server timezone misconfigured

**Solution:**
```bash
# Check server timezone
timedatectl

# Set timezone (example: US Eastern)
sudo timedatectl set-timezone America/New_York

# Restart application
```

---

### **Problem 2: Model Doesn't Use Date**

**Cause:** Model ignoring date information

**Solution:**
- Date is in system prompt, model should use it
- Try more explicit queries: "As of today, what..."
- Enable web search for current information

---

### **Problem 3: Outdated Information Despite Date**

**Cause:** Web search not enabled or no recent results

**Solution:**
1. Enable web search toggle
2. Check web search API keys
3. Verify internet connection
4. Try more specific date-based queries

---

## Summary

### **What Changed:**

‚úÖ **Current date added** to every system prompt  
‚úÖ **Current time included** for temporal context  
‚úÖ **Full date/time provided** with day of week  
‚úÖ **Automatic updates** on every request  
‚úÖ **No user action needed** - Works automatically  

### **Benefits:**

‚úÖ **Accurate time-sensitive responses**  
‚úÖ **Better web search queries**  
‚úÖ **Relative time understanding**  
‚úÖ **Temporal context for RAG**  
‚úÖ **Current events awareness**  

### **Use Cases:**

‚úÖ **Current events** - "What's happening today?"  
‚úÖ **Upcoming events** - "What's coming up?"  
‚úÖ **Historical context** - "What happened last month?"  
‚úÖ **Comparative analysis** - "Compare Q4 2024 to Q4 2023"
