# RAG Usage Fix - Model Now Uses Knowledge Base Content

## Problem Solved

**Issue:** The model was not using knowledge base content even when RAG was enabled. It would respond with general knowledge instead of referencing the uploaded documents.

**Root Causes Identified:**

1. **Weak Instructions:** The system prompt just said "Please use the above context when relevant" - too passive
2. **Duplicate System Messages:** Old system messages in conversation history caused confusion
3. **Poor Visibility:** RAG context was buried in the system prompt without clear boundaries
4. **No Enforcement:** Model could easily ignore the RAG context

---

## Solution Implemented

### **1. Strong, Explicit RAG Instructions**

**Before:**
```python
if rag_context:
    system_prompt += f"\n\nRelevant context from knowledge base:\n{rag_context}\n\nPlease use the above context to answer the user's question when relevant."
```
❌ Weak instruction ("Please use when relevant")
❌ No clear boundaries
❌ Easy to ignore

**After:**
```python
if rag_context:
    system_prompt += f"\n\n{'='*80}\n"
    system_prompt += "IMPORTANT - KNOWLEDGE BASE CONTEXT:\n"
    system_prompt += f"{'='*80}\n"
    system_prompt += "The user has enabled RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) with a knowledge base.\n"
    system_prompt += "Below is the relevant context retrieved from the knowledge base:\n\n"
    system_prompt += rag_context
    system_prompt += f"\n\n{'='*80}\n"
    system_prompt += "INSTRUCTIONS FOR USING KNOWLEDGE BASE:\n"
    system_prompt += "1. PRIORITIZE the information from the knowledge base context above\n"
    system_prompt += "2. CITE specific sources (file names) when using information from the knowledge base\n"
    system_prompt += "3. If the knowledge base contains relevant information, BASE your answer on it\n"
    system_prompt += "4. If the knowledge base doesn't contain relevant information, clearly state this\n"
    system_prompt += "5. You may supplement with your general knowledge, but make it clear what comes from where\n"
    system_prompt += f"{'='*80}\n"
```
✅ **Strong instructions** (PRIORITIZE, BASE, CITE)
✅ **Clear visual boundaries** (80-char separators)
✅ **Numbered steps** for clarity
✅ **Explicit expectations** for citations

---

### **2. Fixed Duplicate System Messages**

**Before:**
```python
# Conversation history might contain old system messages
messages = [{"role": "system", "content": system_prompt}] + conversation_history
# Result: Two system messages if conversation_history[0] is a system message!
```
❌ Duplicate system messages confuse the model
❌ Old system prompt conflicts with new one

**After:**
```python
# Remove any old system messages from conversation history
conversation_history = [msg for msg in conversation_history if msg['role'] != 'system']

# Now add fresh system prompt
messages = [{"role": "system", "content": system_prompt}] + conversation_history
```
✅ **Only one system message** (the current one)
✅ **No conflicts** between old and new prompts
✅ **Clean conversation history** (user/assistant only)

---

### **3. Enhanced Logging for Debugging**

**Added comprehensive logging:**

```python
# When RAG is enabled
logging.info(f"RAG enabled: Searching knowledge base '{kb_name}' for query: '{user_message}'")

# When results are found
logging.info(f"✓ RAG: Retrieved {len(search_results)} relevant chunks from '{kb_name}'")
logging.info(f"✓ RAG: Context length: {len(rag_context)} characters")
logging.info(f"✓ RAG: Sources: {', '.join(set(r['file_name'] for r in search_results))}")

# When no results
logging.warning(f"⚠ RAG: No results found in knowledge base '{kb_name}' for query")

# When RAG is misconfigured
logging.warning("⚠ RAG enabled but no knowledge base selected")

# Before sending to model
logging.info(f"✓ System prompt includes RAG context ({len(rag_context)} chars)")
```

**Benefits:**
✅ See exactly what's being retrieved
✅ Verify RAG context is being added
✅ Debug configuration issues
✅ Track which sources are used

---

## How It Works Now

### **Step-by-Step Process:**

1. **User enables RAG and selects knowledge base**
   ```
   User: "What is the refund policy?"
   RAG: Enabled
   KB: "company_policies"
   ```

2. **System searches knowledge base**
   ```
   LOG: RAG enabled: Searching knowledge base 'company_policies' for query: 'What is the refund policy?'
   LOG: ✓ RAG: Retrieved 3 relevant chunks from 'company_policies'
   LOG: ✓ RAG: Context length: 1247 characters
   LOG: ✓ RAG: Sources: refund_policy.pdf, terms_of_service.pdf
   ```

3. **System builds strong prompt with RAG context**
   ```
   ================================================================================
   IMPORTANT - KNOWLEDGE BASE CONTEXT:
   ================================================================================
   The user has enabled RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) with a knowledge base.
   Below is the relevant context retrieved from the knowledge base:

   [Source: refund_policy.pdf]
   Our refund policy allows customers to request a full refund within 30 days...

   [Source: terms_of_service.pdf]
   Refunds are processed within 5-7 business days...

   ================================================================================
   INSTRUCTIONS FOR USING KNOWLEDGE BASE:
   1. PRIORITIZE the information from the knowledge base context above
   2. CITE specific sources (file names) when using information from the knowledge base
   3. If the knowledge base contains relevant information, BASE your answer on it
   4. If the knowledge base doesn't contain relevant information, clearly state this
   5. You may supplement with your general knowledge, but make it clear what comes from where
   ================================================================================
   ```

4. **Model responds using RAG context**
   ```
   Assistant: Based on the company's refund policy (from refund_policy.pdf),
   you can request a full refund within 30 days of purchase. According to the
   terms of service (terms_of_service.pdf), refunds are processed within 5-7
   business days after approval.
   ```

5. **Logging confirms RAG was used**
   ```
   LOG: ✓ System prompt includes RAG context (1247 chars)
   LOG: Sending to model: 3 messages (1 system + 2 history)
   ```

## Visual Comparison

### **Before Fix:**

```
System Prompt:
"You are a helpful AI assistant. [context buried here somewhere]"

Assistant: "Refund policies typically vary by company, but generally you can
expect to request refunds within 30 days..." [Generic answer, not from KB]
```
❌ Model ignores knowledge base
❌ Gives generic answer
❌ No citations

---

### **After Fix:**

```
System Prompt:
"You are a helpful AI assistant.

================================================================================
IMPORTANT - KNOWLEDGE BASE CONTEXT:
================================================================================
[Clear, prominent RAG context with strong instructions]
================================================================================
INSTRUCTIONS FOR USING KNOWLEDGE BASE:
1. PRIORITIZE the information from the knowledge base context above
2. CITE specific sources...
================================================================================"

User: "What is the refund policy?"

Assistant: "Based on the company's refund policy (from refund_policy.pdf),
you can request a full refund within 30 days of purchase. According to the
terms of service (terms_of_service.pdf), refunds are processed within 5-7
business days after approval." [Uses KB content with citations!]
```
✅ Model uses knowledge base
✅ Cites specific sources
✅ Accurate, relevant answer

---

## Testing the Fix

### **How to Test:**

1. **Create a knowledge base with test content**
   - Upload a document with specific information
   - Example: A PDF about "Company Policies"

2. **Enable RAG and select the knowledge base**
   - Use quick toggle or settings panel
   - Select your test knowledge base

3. **Ask a question that's answered in the document**
   - Example: "What is the refund policy?"
   - The answer should be in your uploaded document

4. **Check the response**
   - Should cite the source file
   - Should use information from the document
   - Should not give generic answers

5. **Check the server logs**
   - Look for RAG logging messages
   - Verify context was retrieved and sent to model

---

## Expected Behavior

### **Scenario 1: Information IS in Knowledge Base**

**Query:** "What is the refund policy?"
**KB Contains:** Refund policy document

**Expected Response:**
```
Based on the refund policy document (refund_policy.pdf), customers can
request a full refund within 30 days of purchase. The refund will be
processed within 5-7 business days after approval.
```

**Server Logs:**
```
INFO: RAG enabled: Searching knowledge base 'company_policies' for query: 'What is the refund policy?'
INFO: ✓ RAG: Retrieved 3 relevant chunks from 'company_policies'
INFO: ✓ RAG: Context length: 1247 characters
INFO: ✓ RAG: Sources: refund_policy.pdf
INFO: ✓ System prompt includes RAG context (1247 chars)
```

✅ **Correct:** Uses KB content, cites source

---

### **Scenario 2: Information NOT in Knowledge Base**

**Query:** "What is the weather today?"
**KB Contains:** Company policies (no weather info)

**Expected Response:**
```
I don't have information about the current weather in the knowledge base.
The knowledge base contains company policies and procedures, but not weather
information. If you need weather information, you could enable web search,
or I can provide general information about how to check the weather.
```

**Server Logs:**
```
INFO: RAG enabled: Searching knowledge base 'company_policies' for query: 'What is the weather today?'
INFO: ✓ RAG: Retrieved 0 relevant chunks from 'company_policies'
INFO: ⚠ RAG: No results found in knowledge base 'company_policies' for query
```

✅ **Correct:** Acknowledges KB doesn't have the info

---

### **Scenario 3: RAG Enabled but No KB Selected**

**Query:** "What is the refund policy?"
**RAG:** Enabled
**KB:** None selected

**Expected Response:**
```
[Generic answer based on general knowledge]
```

**Server Logs:**
```
WARNING: ⚠ RAG enabled but no knowledge base selected
```

⚠️ **Warning:** Need to select a knowledge base

---

## Troubleshooting

### **Problem: Model still not using KB content**

**Check 1: Is RAG actually enabled?**
```
Look for: ✓ next to 📚 RAG toggle
Or check settings panel: ☑ Enable RAG
```

**Check 2: Is a knowledge base selected?**
```
Look for: Knowledge base name in dropdown
Not: "Select KB..." or "None"
```

**Check 3: Does the KB have content?**
```
Settings → Manage Knowledge Bases → Check document count
Should show: "X documents" not "0 documents"
```

**Check 4: Check server logs**
```
Look for:
✓ RAG: Retrieved X relevant chunks
NOT:
⚠ RAG: No results found
```

**Check 5: Is the query relevant to KB content?**
```
If KB contains "Company Policies"
Good query: "What is the refund policy?"
Bad query: "What is the weather?"
```

---

### **Problem: RAG retrieves content but model ignores it**

**This should be FIXED now**, but if it still happens:

**Check 1: Verify system prompt includes strong instructions**
```
Look in logs for:
✓ System prompt includes RAG context (XXXX chars)
```

**Check 2: Check if context is too long**
```
If context > 10,000 chars, model might truncate
Solution: Reduce WEB_SEARCH_TEXT_LENGTH in .env
```

**Check 3: Try a more specific query**
```
Instead of: "Tell me about the company"
Try: "What is the refund policy?"
```

---

### **Problem: Model cites wrong sources**

**Possible causes:**

1. **Multiple documents with similar content**
   - Solution: Use more specific queries

2. **Chunks from different files mixed**
   - This is normal - model should cite all sources

3. **Old conversation history**
   - Solution: Start a new session

---
